<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Through
a combination of ambition and curiosity, BeeKeeper was created by individuals
around the world with a shared vision of supporting those that support the
bees. Support can come in a multitude of ways thanks to the creation of Bitcoin
and the technologies that grew from it. Our intentions are to utilize the
capabilities of the blockchain and smart contracts to the benefit of the bees.
As varied and diverse the problems our bees face around the world are, so are
the tools and solutions needed to give them a fair chance at survival.
BeeKeeper aims to perpetually be in pursuit of assisting with providing
solutions, so this means as the challenges our bees face change over time, so
will our plan of action to assist with bee conservation around the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>BeeKeeper aims to be operational for as long as the
blockchain itself is present, motivating us to act in a manner that mimics the
trustless nature of Bitcoin. By default, this establishes taxonomies and a framework
to operate within while also creating a portion of our roadmap. This framework
of decision-making will establish a certain level of decentralization for
BeeKeeper, so it is important to understand how to measure decentralization for
both a token and an LLC. Even though pursuing a trustless and decentralized
state of operations is part of BeeKeepers overarching theme, we feel as if
there are inhibitions to pursuing 100% decentralized operations. Because of
this, we will attempt to track our level of decentralization, learn our
centralization thresholds, and display our framework of decision making along
the way. We will pursue a balance between decentralization and centralization solely
for the benefit of BeeKeeper. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              BeeKeeper was
created with the purpose of combining blockchain capabilities with real-world
utility. BeeKeepers real-world utility will be harnessing blockchain
technology for the ability to effect greater change at the ground level for one

abilities of cryptocurrency to provide financial resources to those who are
focused on conserving bees around the world and educating us along the way.</span></p>

more than 20,000 known wild bee species and an estimated 30,000 honey bee
species around the world, though most of the available data seems to be from
North America and Europe it is not for a lack of trying. (S.G.
Potts, 2016) (Council, 2007) There are bees that are social, like bumble bees, that
live together and share in the baby-rearing and provisioning of foods, and
there are others that are solitary, which live and raise their brood alone. (Moisset, 2011) Even though there are many ways to segment and categorize bees, for the
sake of this whitepaper, we will view bees as either native or non-native bees.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Western
honey bees (Apis mellifera) are native to Africa, Europe, and Western Asia and
are usually referred to as non-native bees in other locations around the world.
Nearly 17,000 species of honey bees have been formally described, and as many
as 30,000 are estimated worldwide. (Council, 2007) The</span> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Apis mellifera, is often cited as the honey bee even
though there are at least eight other honey bee species, which all produce
honey. For example, there is the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata), the dwarf
honey bee (Apis florea), and the Bornean honey bee (Apis koschevnikovi) only
exist as wild populations. However, because the eight other honey bees live
in mild tropical climates, they have no need to store large amounts of nectar,
their main energy source, because they can find enough flowers to meet their
energy needs throughout the year. Whereas the Apis mellifera has evolved over
regions with limited flower production, or periods of it (winter, rainy days,
etc), that lead to storing large amounts of nectar that dehydrate over time,
turning into honey, which is then a source of energy for the bees year-round. (Requier, 2019) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              A
hive is the bees home and a colony is a queen and all of her worker bees
located in one hive. And since honey bees are one of only a few species that
live in a hive, this allows for them to be moved around from location to
location efficiently. Production of honey, the large number of bees in one
hive, and excellent crop pollination partly explain why honey bees have
travelled all over the world and are considered non-native bees in some areas.
And it is estimated that there are 81 million bee hives around the world producing
1.6 million tons of honey annually. (S.G. Potts, 2016)       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              The
honey bee is a social organism that lives in hives which can contain in upwards
of 50,000 bees that are primarily worker bees (females) further subdivided by
castes, but all under the direction of a single queen (Agency, 2012). The
individual bee cannot function independent of the hive for prolonged periods;
therefore, the functional unit of the honey bee is the colony itself. (Agency, 2012)  Given that the hive is composed of thousands of bees, it has been likened
to a superorganism. (Agency, 2012)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Interestingly,
there were no honey bees in America before European settlers brought hives from
Europe. (Moisset, 2011)  These resourceful animals promptly managed to escape
from domestication and as they had done for millennia in Europe and Asia, honey
bees formed swarms and set up nests in hollow trees and other areas. (Moisset, 2011)  The honey bee, remarkable as it is, does not know how to pollinate tomato
or eggplant flowers and it does very poorly compared to native bees when
pollinating many native plants, such as pumpkins, cherries, blueberries, and
cranberries. (Moisset, 2011)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>               Native
bees come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and are as varied in
their life styles as well. From the seasons they prefer, the flowers they
visit, and the nests they build, there are so many descriptions that it would
exceed what is required here. In the United States, native bees provide
pollination to roughly 80% of flowering plants and aside from cuckoo bees, all
bees build nests.  (Moisset, 2011) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Solitary
is a term that is used when referencing native bees at times, and it turns out
that of the known bee species, roughly 98% are solitary bees where they do not
live in large groups, with a few examples being the mason bee, plasterer bee,
blue orchard bee, squash bee, teddy bear bee, and the carpenter bee. (Lab, 2021) Approximately 70% of female solitary bees prepare their own nests in the
ground, while the remaining nests are usually prepared in cracks in wood. (Lab, 2021)  And in either location, the females prepare her brood cells, gathers nectar
and pollen into each cell, and then lays her eggs in those cells and provides
no further help to the next generation after they are born. (Lab,

though there is a consensus to the lack of global bee data available, there are
several databases that attempt to be a resource. For example, the Bee Database Project
at the American Museum of Natural History and the World Bee Checklist by the
Integrated Taxonomic Information System provide valuable information on bees
around the world that is beneficial on many levels. Though comprehensively,
there is still a lack of data, and consequently, knowledge of pollinator
diversity still remains poor. To date, the primary cause of this is
insufficient reliable occurrence data and the corresponding analytical and
taxonomic expertise required to identify the bee species. For example, there
are millions of museum specimens that await identification, or even formal description,
and remain inaccessible to researchers, which could be of valuable information
upon inspection. (Orr, et al., 2021) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Because
there is a lack of global data available to utilize, it will be part of our
mission to assist in filling in those knowledge gaps. For example, public records
(Table 2) illustrate that the United States has over 60% of the sampling points
with the state of California having more than double the number of records of
any country (except Sweden). (Orr, et al., 2021) The best sampled countries in
Africa, Asia, and South America only represent less than 4% of all data points
in public data. (Orr, et al., 2021) Only 12% of countries have over 95% of
their land area sampled, while contrastingly, almost 15% of countries have
under 5% of their land area sampled, and 55% have under 25% of their land area
sampled. (Orr, et al., 2021) As it turns out, this equates to 90% of North
Asia, 86% of South Asia, 82% of the Middle East, and 79% of Africa and Eurasia
are completely unsampled. (Orr, et al., 2021) Globally, this means that some of
the most species-rich countries have the least available data. For example,
China and Mexico are two of the most species-rich countries, 6<sup>th</sup> and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Over
two-thirds of the earths food is available because of the pollination of plants,
flowers, and vegetables by bees. (Claire Kremen, 2002) Pollination is the
process of pollen being transferred from the anthers of male plants to the stigmata
of female plants so that seeds can be produced from the newly fertilized female
plant. (Sukumaran, Khanduri, &amp; Sharma, 2020) This simple action is a
significant role in agriculture and is a cornerstone of crop production even
though its taking place on accident. Honey bees rely dominantly on nectar and
pollen for food, and a little on oils and honeydews, and it turns out that the
dehydration of nectar is what creates honey. (Requier, 2019) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              The
majority of solitary bees are polylectic (i.e., collect pollen from numerous
plant species), while a smaller number are oligolectic (use a narrow range of
plants) and very few are monolithic (use pollen from only a single plant
species).</span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(Mark A Hall, 2020)</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> Although native bee species are often more efficient
pollinators than are honey bees on a flower-by-flower basis, honey bees are,
for many reasons, the pollinator of choice for most North American crops. (Council, 2007) Honey bee colonies are able to muster large numbers of pollinators when
they are needed for late winter and early spring blooms, as well as throughout
the rest of the growing season. And generally speaking, honey bee can pollinate
many agricultural crops, including almond and blueberry and especially because
it forages over long distances (up to 14 km or 8.6 miles from its nest). In
addition, honey bees exhibit sophisticated communication, which increases
foraging efficiency, and floral constancy; individuals repeatedly visit a
single plant species during each foraging trip and can recruit nestmates to
flowers of that species. (Council, 2007)</span></p>

and so is the vegetation. Pollination of crops is seasonal at times and while
bees live according to their own schedule this creates gaps in production for
some of our crops. Even though there has been research surrounding the
challenges of bees, not all plants like all bees and the same goes the other
way around, not all bees like every one of the plants they visit, and the more
we know about this, the better. When we fail there are opportunities to learn,
for example when eusocial yellowjacket wasps were introduced to the Hawaiian
Islands, they had a negative impact on vegetation. (Keng-Lou James Hung, 2019) We
seem to understand how pollination works though at times we lack the
understanding of how our pollinators interact with our own environments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              In
2002, a survey of feral honey bee colonies in Arnot Forest, New York was
conducted and found that the number of honey bee colonies was about the same in
1978 as it was in 2002. However, another study was conducted on the spread of
varroa mites within Californias population of feral honey bees and in 1990, a
sample of bees from 208 colonies located in feral hives revealed no varroa
mites, though in 1993, a survey of 124 of the same feral hives revealed 75
percent of these colonies no longer existed, and all surviving colonies were
infested with varroa. The proximity of these feral colonies relative to
commercial apiaries suggest that the mites moved from commercial to feral
colonies. (Council, 2007) This is an example of the possible changes between bee
populations and how they can be so drastic. </span></p>

billion worth of global food production was directly contributed by pollinators
while the volume of agricultural production has increased by 300% in the last

the total economic value of agriculture production used directly for food in
the world. (Klein, et al., 2006) In the USA alone, pollination results in $16
billion annually. (Khalifa, et al., 2021) In countries that grow cash crops
such as coffee, cocoa, almonds, and soybeans, they have a much greater reliance
on bee pollination in agriculture at a large scale comparatively. (Khalifa, et al., 2021) Financially, in the United States, honey bees are responsible for
the pollination of up to $12 billion in food. (Khalifa, et al., 2021) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              On
average, pollinator-dependent crops have higher prices than non-pollinator-dependent
crops and the distribution of these monetary benefits is not uniform, with the
greatest additional production occurring in parts of Eastern Asia, the Middle
East, Mediterranean Europe, and North America. The additional monetary output
linked to pollination services accounts for 5% - 15% of total crop output in
different United Nations regions, with the greatest contributions in the Middle
East, South Asia, and East Asia. In the absence of animal pollination, changes
in global crop supplies could increase prices to consumers and reduce profits
to producers, resulting in a potential annual net loss of economic welfare of
$160 billion-$191 billion globally to crop consumers and producers and a
further $207 billion-$497 billion to producers and consumers in other, non-crop

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              A
significant source of the economic importance of honey bees is that
apiculturethe management of honey beesis a highly developed discipline that
has made bees and beekeeping equipment widely available. For example, Latin
America produces 28% of the global honey supply with 7.7 million managed honey
bee colonies while Argentina leads the global list of countries in terms of the
honey market, with more than $200,000 dollars intake related to exports of

because honey bees can be cared for and maintained by humans, they are buffered

important for us to understand each of those challenges at depth so that we can
act accordingly and attempt to increase bee populations around the world

1999, 2004a, 2005, 2006a). Overall, the number of managed colonies dropped from
5.9 million in 1947 to 2.6 million in 19962004 and that number fell again in
2005 to 2.4 million. The decline from 1985 to 1996 is likely linked to the occurrence
of the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi (first detected in 1984) and to the Varroa
destructor mite (first detected in 1987). (Council, 2007) The varroa mite has
been studied over the course of the last fifty years, but the conclusion that

varroa mite, meaning that other half of the colonies lost exhibited no known causes

introduced non-native protozoan parasites, including Nosema bombi and Crithidia
bombi, probably from commercial bumble bees imported from Europe for greenhouse
pollination. The bees frequently harbor pathogens and their escape from
greenhouses can lead to infections in native species. Disease, notably
chalkbrood (caused by the fungal pathogen Ascosphaera aggregata), also has harmed

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ecologically,
bees can be separated into two groups based on the relative length of their
tongues, called proboscides, which are used to gather nectar in flowers. (Moisset, 2011) At first glance this may seem to be irrelevant or unnecessary data, though
it is important in partly understanding the relationships between bees and the
flowers or crops they pollinate. However, they are difficult to measure so it
is rarely included in the ecological analysis of bees. (Daniel P. Cariveau,
2016) We dont have all the necessary data to categorize bees ecologically
according to their proboscides, though, this aspect of bees is worth mentioning
here as it illustrates their importance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
ecological impact to bees could be the most important aspect affecting their
decline, Pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides have both a direct
and indirect negative effect on pollinators, though it is essential to search
for positive affects as well. Since honey bees are responsible for a
significant portion of total crop pollination, combined with the Colony
Collapse Disorder, there has been an increased level of research done on honey
bees, and rightfully so, though more research is needed on native bees. (Maini, 2010)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Landscapes
all around the world are changed for many reasons, from Mountain-Top-Removal in
search of coal to dredging rivers for larger port capacities. Natural wetlands have
been manipulated for mosquito control, and these activities can affect
pollinator populations because wetlands can provide important bee forage. The
most widespread current manipulation programs of natural wetlands are probably
salt marsh water management techniques that are designed to control salt marsh
mosquitoes by minimizing water retention in puddles in the high marsh and
allowing fish access to ponds and puddles to control larvae. (Howard
S. Ginsberg, 2017) To our knowledge, there have been no studies that
specifically quantified the effects of open marsh water management practices on
the availability of floral resources for pollinators. (Howard S. Ginsberg,
2017) Planting of ornamentals, while beneficial to some pollinators, can
sometimes serve as mosquito larval habitat. For example, Ae. aegypti readily
breeds in artificial containers of water. (Howard S. Ginsberg, 2017)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Habitat
manipulation for tick control includes clearing of leaf litter (Schulze et al.
1995), removing lower vegetation and ground cover (Milne 1948, Hubalek et al.
2006), opening the tree canopy (Mount 1981), and controlled burning (Wilson
1986, Stafford et al. 1998). These practices would make conditions less
favorable for some plant species, but more favorable for others, so the effects
on pollinator resources would depend on local conditions and the specific
manipulations applied. Similarly, because of the diversity of nesting habitat
preferences by different bee species, these practices would vary in their
effects on quality of bee nesting habitat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In
some instances, pesticides are applied to crops when the vegetation itself is
blooming, and by default, increases the exposure that bees have to the
pesticides. (Heller, 2020) As Ginsberg  2017 states below: </span></p>

12.0pt'>The risks to pollinators presented by pesticides used for disease
vector control depend upon the toxicities, targeting of applications, and
environmental fates of those pesticides. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency characterizes pesticides in terms of relative toxicity to different
ecological receptors, including birds, aquatic organisms (fish and
invertebrates), wild mammals, and nontarget insects. With respect to honey
bees, the categories are 1) highly toxic when the acute toxicity value (LD50 from
acute contact testing, OPP 850.3020) is&lt; 2 mg/bee, 2) moderately toxic when
the LD50 is between 2 and 10.99 mg/bee, and 3) practically nontoxic when the
LD50 11 mg/bee. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos, malathion, and naled, and
most of the pyrethroids and pyrethrins, along with imidacloprid and fipronil,
are categorized as highly toxic to honey bees with direct exposure (Table 2). A
categorization of practically nontoxic was assigned to the bacterial toxin from
a subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis (kurstaki). The toxicity of methoprene
to honey bees was not reported by the USEPA. While the honey bee acute toxicity
data for select insecticides summarized in Table 2 might be useful as a guide
or rule of thumb for toxicity to a local bee community, recent research has
shown that while modes of action are the same among bee species, toxicities
vary greatly. For instance, Sanchez-Bayo and Goka (2014) reported that honey
bees are considerably more sensitive to permethrin than bumble bees (Bombus
spp.) but less sensitive to carbaryl. Biddinger et al. (2013) found honey bees
to be far less sensitive to the neonicotinoid insecticide, acetamiprid, than
Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski), but sensitivity to the neonicotinoid
imidacloprid was reversed, the honey bee being far more sensitive than O.
lignaria Say. Thus, while the large volume of accumulated data on honey bee
toxicity to insecticides is useful, these data cannot be directly applied to
the native bee community or to other pollinators in North America. Toxicities
of insecticides to native bees and other wild insect pollinators are important
areas for future research</span></p>

one in sub-Saharan Africa, which is considered the main producer of cotton,
found that bee pollination increases the cotton yield to 62% compared with an
estimated 37% without bee pollination. From apples in Pakistan, strawberries in
Germany, coconuts in Mexico, avocados in Central America, and to tomatoes in
Brazil, we have learned that bees increase both the quality and quality after
being introduced as pollinators. (Mark A Hall, 2020)</span></p>

honey bee, </span><i>Apis mellifera,</i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> is
often valued as the most important pollinator to our crops globally for a
variety of reasons, though a few are because there can be between 10,000 and
30,000 bees in one colony and because they stay busy year round pollinating. There
are 17,000 species of bees that have been formally described, but it is
estimated that there are up to 30,000 species of honey bees worldwide (Michener,
2000) In North America honey bees are responsible for pollinating over 100
commercial crops and billions of dollars in value each year. According to the United
States Department of Agriculture, there were 2.7 million honey bee colonies
that produced 147 million lbs. of honey for over $299 million in 2020 alone.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Bees are
responsible for 34% of pollination service demands in the United Kingdom. (Khalifa, et al., 2021) In Egypt, when compared to other insects, honey bees have been
shown to significantly improve the seed percentage and seed yield in onions. (Ewies &amp; EL-Sahhar, 1977)</span></p>

shows that up to 30% of all crops, like tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, peppers,
cherries, and apples, are dependent on being pollinated by native bees only,
meaning, that if native bees were to disappear, so would some of the food we
eat. About 20%-45% of native bees are pollen specialists, meaning that they use
only pollen from one species (or genus) of plants. If that plant is removed,
the bee goes away and if bees are removed, the plant doesn't reproduce. Some of
the native bees are specialists on the very plants that we use for food,
including squashes, pumpkins, gourds, and the annual sunflower.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
background:yellow'>Insect-pollinated legumes have the ability to collect
nitrogen from the air, store it in the roots, and ultimately leave it to enrich
the soil for other plants. Without this beneficial effect, soils not fertilized
by processed minerals would soon be depleted and become economically
unproductive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
animal products we consume contribute about an equal amount to our diet as
plants do. (Guidry 1964) These include beef, pork, poultry, lamb, and dairy
products--derived one way or another from insect-pollinated legumes such as
alfalfa, clover, lespedeza, and trefoil. (Guidry 1964) More than half of the
world's diet of fats and oils comes from oilseeds--coconuts, cotton, oil palm,
olives, peanuts, rape, soybeans, and sunflower (Guidry 1964). Many of these
plants are dependent upon or benefited by insect pollination and when these
sources, the animal and plant products, are considered, it appears that perhaps
one-third of our total diet is dependent, directly or indirectly, upon
insect-pollinated plants. (Guidry 1964) Specifically, one example is the alfalfa
seed, a bee-pollinated crop with an annual value of $109 million (direct
effect), is used to produce hay for livestock forage that is valued at $4.6
billion per year (indirect effect). (Calderone, 2000) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In
other ways, pollinators contribute to crops that provide biofuels, fibers,
medicines, forage for livestock, candles, musical instruments, and even
construction materials. (Nations, 2016) And there are even some anti-bacterial,
anti-fungal, and anti-diabetic agents derived from honey, illustrating the
dynamic value bees have to us all. (S.G. Potts, 2016)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Not

decentralized and operate according to the logic of the smart contract.
However, technology is increasing and no longer is a smart contract immutable,

opportunity for BeeKeeper to provide direct and immediate donations within our
local neighborhoods to individuals who are practicing ways to conserve bees.
Actions like planting a bee-friendly garden or creating homes for bees, especially
for solitary bees who prefer to live alone and not in a hive. These actions
have the potential to provide a more direct impact on conserving bees, though
there are indirect actions that are needed as well, like raising awareness and
being an educator in your area, or not decreasing the use of pesticides.          </span></p>
